* truth-tables

truth-tables is used to produce truth tables from logical
propositions.  Propositions consist of either propositional variables
(non-reserved Lisp symbols) or compound forms (lists headed by the
symbols *and*, *or*, *xor*, *->*, *not* and containing propositional
variables and other compound forms).

*and* and *or* are variadic, *not*, *->* and *xor* have the usual arities.

For example, running

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(print-truth-table '(xor (-> p q) (and p (not q))))
#+END_SRC

produces

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
 P | Q | (NOT Q) | (AND P (NOT Q)) | (-> P Q) | (XOR (-> P Q) (AND P (NOT Q))) 
 T | T |       F |               F |        T |                              T 
 T | F |       T |               T |        F |                              T 
 F | T |       F |               F |        T |                              T 
 F | F |       T |               F |        T |                              T 
#+END_SRC

This program flouts proper Lisp style and should not be viewed by
anyone.
